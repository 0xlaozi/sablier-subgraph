## Sablier Subgraph

The Graph is a tool that helps dapps index their blockchain data so that users don't have to wait hours or more for the
website to load.

In this repo, you'll find our subgraph, that is, a collection of schemas and event handlers that
parse the data broadcast on the Ethereum blockchain to GraphQL form. Later, the dapp retrieves the data and shows
it to the end users.
